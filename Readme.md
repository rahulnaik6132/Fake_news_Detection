# Fake News Classification using NLP + LSTM

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (LSTM) to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using the Kaggle Fake/Real News Dataset.

---

## Features
- Complete text preprocessing pipeline  
- NLTK stopwords + lemmatization  
- Deep learning model using LSTM  
- Achieved **99% test accuracy**  

---

## Dataset
Kaggle Fake & Real News Dataset:

- `Fake.csv` → Label 0  
- `True.csv` → Label 1

## Streamlit Web Application

This project includes a **Streamlit-based web app** that allows users to enter any news text and instantly check whether it is **REAL** or **FAKE** using the trained LSTM model.

### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is a Python framework that turns your machine learning models into **interactive web applications** with very little code.

- No HTML/CSS required  
- No JavaScript needed  
- Runs directly from Python  
- Automatically opens in your browser  
- Perfect for ML/DL project demos  

It is widely used for:
- ML/AI demos  
- College project presentations  
- Interactive dashboards  
- Web-based prediction tools
