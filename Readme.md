## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application

This project includes a **Streamlit-based web app** that allows users to enter any news text and instantly check whether it is **REAL** or **FAKE** using the trained LSTM model.

### 🚀 What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is a Python framework that turns your machine learning models into **interactive web applications** with very little code.

- No HTML/CSS required  
- No JavaScript needed  
- Runs directly from Python  
- Automatically opens in your browser  
- Perfect for ML/DL project demos  

It is widely used for:
- ML/AI demos  
- College project presentations  
- Interactive dashboards  
- Web-based prediction tools
